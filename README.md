# 👋 Hi, I’m Zamirrea 💻✨

Welcome to my GitHub!

I’m an aspiring IT Support and Cybersecurity professional with hands-on experience in virtual labs, system administration, and security operations. This profile documents my learning journey as I transition into the tech industry—focusing on practical, self-paced training through platforms like TryHackMe, YouTube labs, and virtual home lab environments.

With a background that bridges IT support, customer service, and hands-on cybersecurity practice, I’m building a career rooted in investigation, defense, and digital problem-solving.

From standing up a home Active Directory lab to diving into SIEM tools and log analysis, I’m actively sharpening the skills I need to protect systems and support blue team operations in a SOC environment.
